# EntertainmentWebApplicaton

This is the finalized version of my Entertainment Web Application tool.  Its purpose is to be a center where all kinds of different entertainment can be categorically organized in a database. This web-app connects to a MySQL database and executes the alloted Java methods to function properly. The user can view, delete, and add books, movies, music, and contacts from the database. Everything is done from the browser through the user-friendly interface.
